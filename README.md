# Hi thereðŸ‘‹ ,welcome to My GitHub Profile!

I'm **Victor Perez**,an specialist in bio-image processing and analysis who finds joy in creating custom image processing solutions.  As a passionate for microscopy ðŸ”¬ and image formation, I'm happy to work with data from different sources, bright-field, confocal, light-sheet, super-resolution, second-harmonic and multiplexed-imaging.

## ðŸ”¬ About Me  

- **Role:** Postdoc at the Spatial Omics | Schapiro Lab [https://www.schapirolab.com](https://www.schapirolab.com) 
- **Location:** Heidelberg, Germany  
- **Organization:** [Institute for Computational Biomedicine](https://www.medizinische-fakultaet-hd.uni-heidelberg.de/organisation/institute/institute-for-computational-biomedicine) 
- **Values:** share knowledge, active learning,

## Current Projects  

- ### Image registration of multiple omics modalitites: metabolomics, proteomics, transcriptomics (upcoming)
Library to register MALDI and MACSima images using a "fiducial" antibody marker.  
[View Repository](https://github.com/SchapiroLabor/femur-multi-omics)

- ### Custom framework to register and stitch CODEX images
Library to register tiles and sample ROIs acquired with the first commercial implementation of CODEX.  The purpose of this library is to enable having a larger area of the tissue in a single image.

- ### Custom processing of MACSima raw data
Package to stage the raw data of the MACSima platform ready for registration with [ashlar](https://pypi.org/project/ashlar/) and/or [mcmicro](https://mcmicro.org/).  Staging involves, flat-field correction, re-writing of single-image ".tif" files into multi-channel ".ome.tif"s, parsing of metadata and calculation of image qc metrics.

- ### Custom processing of CODEX raw data
Package with the same features as the project above but with the inclusion of a function to determine the in-focus plane of a 3D stack.

- ### Other projects 
- **Teaching**: private and public courses for processing and analysis of multiplexed-images,e.g at [physalia](https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/multiplexed-image-analysis/).
